Tier 1: The Basic List (Good)
This is a simple, well-organized text list. It's clean and gets the job done.
markdown
## 🛠️ Technical Skills

**Programming & Databases**
Python (OOP, File I/O, Modular Code), SQL

**Data Analysis & Visualization**
Pandas, NumPy, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Machine Learning**
Scikit-learn, Random Forests, Linear Regression, Decision Trees

**Tools & Platforms**
Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub, VS Code
Tier 2: The Organized & Visual (Better)
This uses icons, badges, or group headings to make the section skimmable in seconds. This is the sweet spot for most portfolios.
markdown
## 🛠️ Technical Skills

### 💻 Programming
`Python` `SQL` `OOP` `File I/O` `APIs`

### 📊 Data Analysis
`Pandas` `NumPy` `EDA` `Data Cleaning` `Data Visualization`

### 🤖 Machine Learning
`Scikit-learn` `Random Forests` `Linear Regression` `Decision Trees`

Tier 3: The Advanced & Interactive (Best)
This is for standing out. It involves more technical setup but creates a memorable experience.
Skill Bars (with caution): Visually show your proficiency level. (Be honest and don't over-inflate).
Interactive Badges: Shields.io or other services can create dynamic badges.
Icons for Everything: Use a consistent icon set (like Font Awesome or simple emojis) for each category.
Example of a more advanced section:

Recommended Structure for YOU
For your portfolio, I'd recommend a hybrid of Tier 2 for its simplicity and effectiveness. Here's a template you can use directly:
markdown
## 🛠️ Technical Skills

**💻 Programming & Software Engineering**
`Python` `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)` `File I/O` `Functions & Modular Code` `SQL`

**📈 Data Analysis & Visualization**
`Pandas` `NumPy` `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)` `Data Cleaning` `Data Preprocessing` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn` `Data Visualization`

**🤖 Machine Learning & AI**
`Scikit-learn` `Random Forests` `Decision Trees` `Linear Regression` `NLP` `SpaCy`

**🔧 Tools & Platforms**
