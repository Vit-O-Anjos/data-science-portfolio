## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Data Scientist and Python Developer with deep expertise in machine learning, neural network architecture, and natural language processing. I specialize in transforming raw and complex data into intelligent solutions using predictive modeling, sarcasm-aware sentiment analysis, and exploratory data analysis that drives actionable business insights. I have engineered neural networks from scratch to model complex logic gates, optimized Random Forests with hyperparameter tuning, and developed modular, scalable ML pipelines using object-oriented Python.

My toolkit includes TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and SpaCy—applied across real-world datasets and projects with consistent top-tier performance. I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills in machine learning, advanced NLP, and data visualization to solve impactful problems and support data-driven decision-making.
