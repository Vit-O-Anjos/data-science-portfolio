# Modular Functions & Code Reusability

## Overview
This project exemplifies best practices in software engineering by applying modular function design and object-oriented programming principles. The focus is on creating clean, reusable, and maintainable code components tailored for data science workflows.

## Technologies & Concepts
- **Python Modular Programming**: Functions, import/export
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Encapsulation, inheritance, abstractions
- **Code Organization**: Separation of concerns, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Documentation and Testing** for function reliability

## Key Features
- Collection of modular functions supporting machine learning pipelines
- Well-documented function APIs with examples
- Scalable design enabling easy integration of new features
- Unit tests to ensure consistent behavior across modules

## Engineering Skills
- Designed maintainable, extensible software modules
- Implemented OOP class hierarchies for complex problem-solving
- Applied software engineering best practices in data science projects
- Achieved high coding standards with thorough documentation
